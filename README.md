## 📅 Roadmap

- [x] Release model code
- [ ] Release training and inference code
- [ ] Release pre-trained model weights

## 🔥 Key Features

- **No Pseudo-Alignment:** Achieves stable alignment implicitly via Joint-DiT attention.
- **Mel-VAE Codec:** Efficient latent representation for faster training and high-fidelity reconstruction.
- **Unified Architecture:** A simple, end-to-end framework without complex multi-stage pipelines.
